This project is a part of [Mozilla Common Voice](https://voice.mozilla.org/en).

Mozilla TTS aims a deep learning based Text2Speech engine, low in cost and high in quality.

You can check some of synthesized voice samples from [here](https://erogol.github.io/ddc-samples/).

If you are new, you can also find [here](http://www.erogol.com/text-speech-deep-learning-architectures/) a brief post about some of TTS architectures and [here](https://github.com/erogol/TTS-papers) list of up-to-date research papers.

### Docker
A docker image is created by [@synesthesiam](https://github.com/synesthesiam) and shared in a separate [repository](https://github.com/synesthesiam/docker-mozillatts) with the latest LJSpeech models.

## Release Models
Please visit [our wiki.](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS/wiki/Released-Models)

## Sample Model Output
Below you see Tacotron model state after 16K iterations with batch-size 32 with LJSpeech dataset.

## Datasets and Data-Loading
TTS provides a generic dataloader easy to use for your custom dataset.
You just need to write a simple function to format the dataset. Check ```datasets/preprocess.py``` to see some examples.
After that, you need to set ```dataset``` fields in ```config.json```.

Some of the public datasets that we successfully applied TTS:

- [LJ Speech](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)
- [Nancy](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/blizzard/2011/lessac_blizzard2011/)
- [TWEB](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanpark/the-world-english-bible-speech-dataset)
- [M-AI-Labs](http://www.caito.de/2019/01/the-m-ailabs-speech-dataset/)
- [LibriTTS](https://openslr.org/60/)
- [Spanish](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sm_zyBo67XHkiFhcRSQ4YaHPYM0slO_e/view?usp=sharing) - thx! @carlfm01

## Training and Fine-tuning LJ-Speech
Here you can find a [CoLab](https://gist.github.com/erogol/97516ad65b44dbddb8cd694953187c5b) notebook for a hands-on example, training LJSpeech. Or you can manually follow the guideline below.

To start with, split ```metadata.csv``` into train and validation subsets respectively ```metadata_train.csv``` and ```metadata_val.csv```. Note that for text-to-speech, validation performance might be misleading since the loss value does not directly measure the voice quality to the human ear and it also does not measure the attention module performance. Therefore, running the model with new sentences and listening to the results is the best way to go.

```
shuf metadata.csv > metadata_shuf.csv
head -n 12000 metadata_shuf.csv > metadata_train.csv
tail -n 1100 metadata_shuf.csv > metadata_val.csv
```

To train a new model, you need to define your own ```config.json``` file (check the example) and call with the command below. You also set the model architecture in  ```config.json```.

```python TTS/bin/train.py --config_path TTS/tts/configs/config.json```

To fine-tune a model, use ```--restore_path```.

```python TTS/bin/train.py --config_path TTS/tts/configs/config.json --restore_path /path/to/your/model.pth.tar```

To continue an old training run, use ```--continue_path```.

```python TTS/bin/train.py --continue_path /path/to/your/run_folder/```

For multi-GPU training use ```distribute.py```. It enables process based multi-GPU training where each process uses a single GPU.

```CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,4" TTS/bin/distribute.py --config_path TTS/tts/configs/config.json```

Each run creates a new output folder and ```config.json``` is copied under this folder.

In case of any error or intercepted execution, if there is no checkpoint yet under the output folder, the whole folder is going to be removed.

You can also enjoy Tensorboard,  if you point Tensorboard argument```--logdir``` to the experiment folder.

## Contribution guidelines
This repository is governed by Mozilla's code of conduct and etiquette guidelines. For more details, please read the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines.](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/)

Please send your Pull Request to ```dev``` branch. Before making a Pull Request, check your changes for basic mistakes and style problems by using a linter. We have cardboardlinter setup in this repository, so for example, if you've made some changes and would like to run the linter on just the changed code, you can use the follow command:

```bash
pip install pylint cardboardlint
cardboardlinter --refspec master
```

## Collaborative Experimentation Guide
If you like to use TTS to try a new idea and like to share your experiments with the community, we urge you to use the following guideline for a better collaboration.
(If you have an idea for better collaboration, let us know)
- Create a new branch.
- Open an issue pointing your branch.
- Explain your experiment.
- Share your results as you proceed. (Tensorboard log files, audio results, visuals etc.)
- Use LJSpeech dataset (for English) if you like to compare results with the released models. (It is the most open scalable dataset for quick experimentation)

## Major TODOs
- [x] Implement the model.
- [x] Generate human-like speech on LJSpeech dataset.
- [x] Generate human-like speech on a different dataset (Nancy) (TWEB).
- [x] Train TTS with r=1 successfully.
- [x] Enable process based distributed training. Similar to (https://github.com/fastai/imagenet-fast/).
- [x] Adapting Neural Vocoder. TTS works with WaveRNN and ParallelWaveGAN (https://github.com/erogol/WaveRNN and https://github.com/erogol/ParallelWaveGAN)
- [ ] Multi-speaker embedding.
- [x] Model optimization (model export, model pruning etc.)
